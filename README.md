# Forrest Gump Graph

## Week 1
- Draw the graph
- Compute the number of nodes,edges, average degree and the density. Comment.

## Week 2
While considering the largest component of your network. Depending on what you prefer/seems
more relevant in your graph,
- Compute Average distance and Diameter,
- Improve the function computing the inverse distance function.

Or

- Compute Average clustering and Transitivity number,
- Implement a function computing the transitivity using basic function of networkx

## Week 3
Depending on what seems more relevant in your graph, pick one of the following local notions

- Decay centrality

- Betweeness centrality

- Closeness centrality

- Clustering

- Any other notion that you invent

1) Provide a code computing the given notion using basic functions of networkx (you are not allowed to use directly the functions of networkx computing it).

2) Discuss why you picked this measure and who is the most central in your network based on your choice.

3) Provide the cumulative distribution for this centrality or the histogram and give a graphical representation of your graph (log-log, log or normal representation as you think it is more relevant).
